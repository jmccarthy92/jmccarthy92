# Welcome!

Hi, I'm James McCarthy and I'm a software engineer from Queens, New York. I currently work full-time as a Lead Backend Engineer @ [BRKFST.IO ](https://www.brkfst.io/). I primarily use TypeScript as my main language for creating solutions. I mostly build apps for the web, but also enjoy programming on all platforms. I focus on providing simplicity for both users and developers. In the words of Robert C. Martin, “*It is not the language that makes programs appear simple. It is the programmer that makes the language appear simple!*”.

I've been writing code for over 7 years and I'm still learning every day. I still have the same passion to grow and learn as I did when I first embarked on this path. I love to share my passion and knowledge so feel free to contact me via email
